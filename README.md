# MLProject

## Introduction

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive resource for our CO2 emission prediction project. Here, you will find the following:

**Code**: Our machine learning models and data preprocessing scripts are available in the src directory. You can explore how we trained and evaluated the models.

**Dataset**: In the ***Dataset*** directory, you can access the datasets we used for training and testing. We believe in transparency and reproducibility, so we've provided the sources and preprocessing details.

**Documentation**: For a deeper understanding of our approach and methodology, please refer to the docs folder. You'll find detailed explanations of the models, algorithms, and evaluation metrics we used.

## Project Goals

Our primary objectives for this project are as follows:

**Accurate Predictions**: We aim to develop machine learning models that can predict CO2 emissions with a high degree of accuracy.
**Transparency**: We believe in transparency in our research. All code and data sources are clearly documented to encourage reproducibility.
